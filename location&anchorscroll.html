<p>If you haven’t tried Angular yet, you’re missing out on why people say JavaScript is the most flexible language in the world.

Angular is the only framework that doesn’t make MVC seem like putting lipstick on a pig.

Most frameworks nowadays are simply a bundling of existing tools. They are an integrated tool set, but not very elegant. Angular is the next generation framework where each tool was designed to work with every other tool in an interconnected way.

Here are 10 reasons why you should be using Angular today.

1. MVC done right
Most frameworks implement MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then require you to write code to string them up together again. That’s a lot of work. Angular implements MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then just let Angular do the rest. Angular manages your components for you and also serves as the pipeline that connects them.

Because Angular acts as the mediator, developers also won’t feel tempted to write shortcuts between components that break abstractions just to make them fit easier.

2. A declarative user interface.
Angular uses HTML to define the app’s user interface. HTML is a declarative language which is more intuitive and less convoluted than defining the interface procedurally in JavaScript. HTML is also less brittle to reorganize than an interface written in JavaScript, meaning things are less likely to break. Plus you can bring in many more UI developers when the view is written in HTML.

HTML is also used to determine the execution of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine which controllers to use for each element. These attributes determine “what” gets loaded, but not “how”. This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and what should get loaded first, you simply define what you want and Angular will take care of the dependencies.

3. Data models are POJO
Data models in Angular are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO) and don’t require extraneous getter and setter functions. You can add and change properties directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will. Your code will look much cleaner and more intuitive, the way mother nature intended.

Traditional data models are the gatekeepers of data and are responsible for data persistence and server syncing. Those data models behave like smart data providers. But since Angular’s data models are plain objects, they behave more like a cork board. A cork board is nothing more than a temporary storage area for people to put and retrieve data. However, Angular’s cork boards work closely with a controller and view. To differentiate it from the traditional sense of data models, Angular calls them “scopes”.

All properties found on the scope object are automatically bound to the view by Angular. Meaning, Angular quietly watches for changes to these properties and updates the view automatically.

The scope has no data to begin with and relies on the controller to feed it data according to business logic needs.

4. Behavior with directives
Directives are Angular’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Imagine a world where HTML has so many rich elements (for example <accordion></accordion>, <grid></grid>, <lightbox></lightbox>, etc.) that we never have to manipulate the DOM to simulate them. All that our app needs to do is to assign attributes to elements to get any functionality out of the box.

Directives achieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. By putting all our DOM manipulation code into directives, we can separate them out of our MVC app. This allows our MVC app to only concern itself with updating the view with new data. How the view subsequently behaves is up to the directives.
